	    Error testing x

	Get AI working / (kinda)
        Get it recognise how many "OUTS" it has in a hand to see how good it is x


CURRENT ISSUES:

     AI ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Cant distinguish if it contributes to the hand

     Doesnt take into account how rare the hand is to come up

     need to fix how it finds straight flushes and pairs:
        if there is a straight and a flush in the hand, it'll assume there's a straight flush, which is untrue
        it only sees pairs that it already has

     if it doesn't have enough money to raise, it relies on chance that it wont try to raise again when prompted by the
     server

     It cant bet, bruh

     Poker -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    File "C:\Users\198591\OneDrive\College Work\Pycharm\NEA Texas Hold 'em Poker\hierarchy.py", line 235, in tie_breaker
        high_card = thand[-1]
    IndexError: list index out of range

    when they have a pair, for some reason their hand contains no other cards and only just the pair flag
    so, try and find out where the cards get lost, or try and re-gain the cards.

    trouble recognising when a player does not have enough to raise
