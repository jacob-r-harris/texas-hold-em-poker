        Get it recognise how many "OUTS" it has in a hand to see how good it is x


CURRENT ISSUES:

     AI ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Cant distinguish if it contributes to the hand

     Doesnt take into account how rare the hand is to come up

     need to fix how it finds straight flushes and pairs:
        if there is a straight and a flush in the hand, it'll assume there's a straight flush, which is untrue
        it only sees pairs that it already has

     if it doesn't have enough money to raise, it relies on chance that it wont try to raise again when prompted by the
     server

     Needs to know the minimum bet

     Poker -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Pot roll over does not give the correct amount of money to the winner

     Small blind somehow loses an extra amount thats determined by how much they put down as a small blind
