# Texas Hold 'Em Poker

A command line Texas Hold 'Em Poker game with all rules and game logic implemented.

The game runs a server with which the clients can play the game over, allowing for online or LAN multiplayer.

_(WIP)_ A basic AI implementation has been added for ability to play a game by one's self.


## How to Run
You first run the server "main_with_nethost.py", followed by 4 clients, which are either: "netClient.py" or "AI.py"

## How to play
This game uses <a href="https://youtu.be/v8dqu_aVQk8?si=sr2D0ffkzqrtiY_X&t=10" target="_blank">basic Texas Hold 'Em rules</a> with cards being represented by their value and then their suit.

For example "jc" is Jack of Clubs or "8d" is 8 of Diamonds. Other inputs are explained be the console read out during play.
